<!--The image is inserted using the <img> tag. 
The only difference from other images is that you must add a usemap attribute:

<img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap">
The usemap value starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map, 
and is used to create a relationship between the image and the image map.

Then, add a <map> element.
The <map> element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute:
<map name="workmap">


Then, add the clickable areas.
A clickable area is defined using an <area> element.

Shape
You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:

rect - defines a rectangular region
circle - defines a circular region
poly - defines a polygonal region
default - defines the entire region
