        <p>The ice shelves of Antarctica were probably first seen in <em>1820</em>, 
            during a Russian expedition led by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen a
            nd Mikhail Lazarev. The decades that followed saw further exploration by French, 
            American, and British expeditions. The first confirmed landing was by a Norwegian 
            team in 1895. In the early 20th century, there were a few expeditions into the interior 
            of the continent. British explorers Douglas Mawson, Edgeworth David, and Alistair Mackay 
            were the first to reach the magnetic South Pole in 1909, and the geographic South Pole was 
            first reached in 1911 by Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen.

    <p class="ani"> Antarctic sea life includes <strong> penguins, blue whales, orcas, colossal 
        squids and fur seals</strong> .The Antarctic fur seal was very heavily hunted in the 18th 
        and 19th centuries for its pelt by seal hunters from the United States and the United Kingdom.
        Leopard seals are apex predators in the Antarctic ecosystem and migrate across the Southern 
        Ocean in search of food.
