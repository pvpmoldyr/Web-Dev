        <h2>What is moth?</h2>

        <p>Moths are a group of insects that includes 
        all members of the order Lepidoptera that are not butterflies.[1]
        They were previously classified as suborder Heterocera, but the group 
        is paraphyletic with respect to butterflies (suborder Rhopalocera) 
        and neither subordinate taxon is used in modern classifications. 
        Moths make up the vast majority of the order.

        <h2>Attraction to light</h2>

        <p>One hypothesis is called celestial or transverse orientation.<br>
        By maintaining a constant angular relationship to a bright celestial light,<br>
        such as the moon, they can fly in a straight line</p>
